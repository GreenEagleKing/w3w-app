# What3Words Password Recovery

The What3Words Password Recovery app allows users to recover their password using map locations. Ultilising the What3Words API and Google Maps users can set a location on the planet and through remembering this location they can retrieve their forgotten password. The aim of this project was to create an app that solves a problem in a creative way.

\*\*It is not been optimised for a responsive layout for mobile yet.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Firebase

This web application is a frontend project that has been fully designed and built by myself. All the UI and functionality is built using ReactJS and JavaScript. I chose to implement a Firebase realtime database to store the user information because of its ease of use and flexibillity.


# The Future:

-Improve the UI design


# Lessons Learned:

- Seperation of concerns
- More optimised and organised project structure to all for better maintainabillity.
