# PassMap

Best viewed on a laptop/monitor

The PassMap uses the What3Words API to allow users to recover their password using map locations. Ultilising the What3Words API and Google Maps users can set a location on the planet and by remembering this location they can retrieve their forgotten password. The aim of this project was to create an app that solves a problem in a creative way. I used Three.js to create an interactive mountainous background to represent contour lines found on OS maps.

\*\*It is not been optimised for a responsive layout for mobile yet.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Three.js, Firebase

This web application is a frontend project that has been fully designed and built by myself. All the UI and functionality is built using ReactJS and JavaScript. I chose to implement a Firebase realtime database to store the user information because of its ease of use and flexibility.


# The Future:
- Integrate OAuth 2.0
- Fix window.reload temporary fix - API issue losing connection when navigating away from Map component.


# Lessons Learned:

- Separation of concerns
- More optimised and organised project structure for better maintainability and readability.
- WebGL interactive background
